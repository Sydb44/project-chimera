# Game Design Document: Project Chimera
**Version: 2.0**

## 1. Core Philosophy
Project Chimera is a systemic space simulation built on the principle of **"Explained Fantasy."** It is a **"story generator"** where players manage the deep, complex systems of their ship within a universe governed by consistent, logical rules. The primary gameplay loop emerges from the collision of the **"Micro Sandbox"** (the ship) and the **"Macro Sandbox"** (the universe).

## 2. Core Architectural Pillars
* **Resonance Core & Power Grid:** The ship's heart is a dimension-siphoning power source that consumes Charged Plasma and distributes energy through a prioritized grid. Its state directly affects all other systems.
* **Phase-Field Projectors & Flight:** An intuitive, "Logical Star Wars" flight model that is directly governed by the state of the ship's power systems. System failures have a natural and predictable impact on flight performance.
* **Nanofarm Technology:** The primary crafting and repair loop. A backpack- or ship-mounted Nanofarm converts raw materials into programmable nanobots used for construction, complex repairs, and specialized tasks.
* **Navigable Dangers (Astrogation):** FTL travel based on a plausible in-universe phenomenon that makes course-plotting a strategic decision with tangible risks and rewards.
